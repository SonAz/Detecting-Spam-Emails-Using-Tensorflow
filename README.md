# ðŸ“§ Detecting Spam Emails using Tensorflow

A Jupyter Notebook project for detecting spam emails using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. This project builds and evaluates a spam email detector using classic NLP preprocessing and classification techniques. It explores the use of various models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to distinguish between **spam** and **ham** (non-spam) messages.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Text preprocessing: lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization.
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words and/or TF-IDF.
- Classification using:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - (optionally) SVM or Random Forest
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix.
- Visualization of model performance
